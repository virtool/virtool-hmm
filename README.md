## Profile HMMs and annotations for Virtool and NuVs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/virtool/virtool-hmm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/virtool/virtool-hmm)

**The integration of this data with Virtool in not complete**

**Description**

The respository contains the profile hidden Markov models (HMM) and their annotations used in NuVs. NuVs purpose is to identify
potential novel viral sequences in Illumina libraries.

**Usage**

You can easily use this data by automatically downloading and installing it from within Virtool. (See the documentation)[https://docs.virtool.ca/hmms.html].

The data can also be manually downloaded:
